# CyclusK Application

## Overview
CyclusK is a tool for the analysis and visualization of qPCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) data and rapid analysis of KAPA Library Quantification Kits. It is designed to streamline the processing of qPCR data files, including baseline subtraction, PCR efficiency calculation, and amplification curve plotting. The application supports various data formats and provides an interactive interface for data exploration and analysis.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Automated baseline subtraction, calculation of Cq values, and PCR efficiency.
- **Visualization**: Dynamic plotting of amplification curves and standard curves.
- **Data Analysis**: Generation of per well/dye results table, standard curve summary, and KAPA library concentration analysis.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly web interface for file upload, parameter configuration, and visualization customization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas: For data manipulation.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For linear regression and other machine learning tasks.
- Streamlit: For creating the web application interface.
- Additional libraries: `gzip`, `io`, `itertools`, `os`, `random`, `re`, `string`, `struct`, `tempfile`, `xml.etree.ElementTree`, `zipfile`.

### Setup
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn streamlit
   ```

3. Download the `cyclusk.py` script to your local machine.

4. Run the application by navigating to the script's directory and executing:

   ```bash
   streamlit run cyclusk.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Start the Application**: Launch CyclusK using the Streamlit command.
2. **Upload Data**: Use the web interface to upload your qPCR data files and any associated labeling files.
3. **Configure Analysis Parameters**: Set the desired parameters for baseline subtraction, Cq value calculation, and more.
4. **Visualize Results**: Explore the amplification curves, standard curves, and results tables generated by the application.
5. **Data Exploration**: Interact with the data through sorting, filtering, and detailed examination of specific wells or samples.
